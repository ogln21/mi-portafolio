      <p>This section covers the FL Studio desktop and basic workflow. FL Studio allows you to load instruments and
        samples, play these live or manually enter the note data, record external sounds (from a microphone for example)
        and play the whole mix back through the mixer (adding effects). The completed project can be saved to a .flp or
        .zip and/or exported (rendered) to .wav, .mp3 or .ogg audio</p>

      <p>While the FL Studio based musician generally has little or no need for extra hardware, it's definitely worth
        considering a controller. Controllers are devices that send control signals to FL Studio to move the knobs,
        switches or play a plugin instrument like a synthesizer. For setting up a controller see the MIDI Settings
        Wizard or MIDI Settings page.</p>

      <p>See <a id="hardwarecontrol" href="https://forum.image-line.com/viewtopic.php?f=1914&t=88824">here</a> for more
        information on supported controllers.</p>

      <p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>To <a id="interfacetoexternalcontrol"

            the FL Studio interface</a> to an external controller, Right-Click the target knob/slider and select 'Link
          controller' from the menu and then move the physical knob on the external controller interface.</li>

        <li>FL Studio stores all note activity from external controllers from the past 3 minutes. This can be dumped to
          the Piano roll at any time using the 'Dump score log to selected pattern' command. Never lose that perfect
          improvisation again!</li>

      <p>Piano roll scripts allow you to manipulate the note data in the Piano roll under the control of Python code.
        For example, select all notes higher than C3 (MIDI note number 36).</p>

      <h4>Script File Locations and File Names</h4>

      <p>FL Studio will check the locations listed below and show any Scripts it finds in the Piano roll Scripts menu.
        If you make or edit scripts put them in the User data 'Piano roll scripts' sub-folder. The user interfaces you
        see associated with scripts are automatically created based on the variables and text entry fields in the
        script.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Script file naming</strong> - Files must end with the .pyscript extension. E.g., Any text you like
          here.pyscript</li>

        <li><strong>User editable scripts</strong> - When creating your own scripts or editing ours, put them in the
          User scripts folder:<br>
          User scripts folder - ...Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Piano roll scripts. NOTE: You can use sub
          folders to create category folders in the Piano roll script menu.</li>

        <li><strong>Default installation folders</strong> - We don't recommend editing these scripts or editing the
          contents of the folders. Rather copy any scripts you want to modify to your 'User scripts folder', add
          'edited' to the name so you don't get confused. If you complain about bugs in factory scripts that you created
          because you didn't follow this advice, our support staff will chastise you many times!</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Check the factory script folder for the file 'Piano roll script reference.txt'. This may
        be more updated than this page in the manual.</p>

      <div class="exscripts">
        <h4>Example scripts:</h4>
        <p>You do not need to install Python, FL Studio will interpret scripts itself. The script files are simply plain
          text format with the extension .pyscript. For example 'Mute selected notes.pyscript' for the example
          below.<br>
          One of the best ways to learn scripting is to make a copy of a simple one, and make edits to it to learn how
          it
          works. For example, text messages on the script etc.</p>

        <p><strong>Mute selected notes:</strong></p>
        <code>
          from flpianoroll import *

          # loop through existing notes and set the "muted" flag
          for i in range(score.noteCount):
          score.getNote(i).muted = True
        </code>

        <p><strong>Script using the 'preview' feature:</strong></p>
        <code>
          from flpianoroll import *

          def createDialog():
          form = ScriptDialog('Add One Note', '')
          form.AddInputKnob('Note Number', 36, 24, 48)
          return form

          def apply(form):
          notenr = round(form.GetInputValue('Note Number'))
          # ... do something here
        </code>

        <p><strong>Check if any key is pressed:</strong></p>
        <code>
          def OnMidiMsg(event):
          event.handled = False
          if event.data2 > 0:
          print('Any Key Pressed')
        </code>

        <p><strong>Check if your specific key is pressed:</strong></p>
        <code>
          if event.data1 == play_key:
          print('Play Key Pressed')
        </code>

        <p><strong>Duplicate Notes an Octave Higher:</strong></p>
        <code>
          def duplicate_notes_octave_up():
          # Check if there are active channels
          if channels.channelCount() == 0:
          ui.showMessageBox("Error", "No active channels.")
          return

          # Get the list of selected notes
          selected_notes = midi.getSelectedNotes()

          # Exit if no notes are selected
          if not selected_notes:
          ui.showMessageBox("Info", "No notes selected.")
          return

          # Duplicate each selected note one octave higher
          for note in selected_notes:
          new_note = midi.MidiNote(
          start=note.start,
          length=note.length,
          pitch=note.pitch + 12, # Increase pitch by 12 semitones (1 octave)
          velocity=note.velocity,
          channel=note.channel,
          isSelected=False
          )
